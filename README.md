# Create React App + Docker 

## Quickstart

```sh
Navigate to local directory using CLI(e.g BASH)
git clone https://github.com/ptxd/react-docker-template.git
npm start
```


## Starting the App

**You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

### npm

```sh
npm init react-app my-app
```

_`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+_

### Yarn

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
```

_[`yarn create <starter-kit-package>`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) is available in Yarn 0.25+_

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

</p>

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.

## Deployment to Local Docker Application

### Build the docker container
```sh
docker build -t react-docker-template .
```

### Run the docker container app
```sh
docker run -p 3000:80 react-docker-template
```


Here are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:

- If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html).

- If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb), or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use [Rails Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). For Symfony, try [Symfony's webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html).

- If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino's react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).

- If you want to do **server rendering** with React and Node.js, check out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle). Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and only produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.

- If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Unlike Create React App, Gatsby pre-renders the website into HTML at build time. Next.js supports both server rendering and pre-rendering.

All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.
